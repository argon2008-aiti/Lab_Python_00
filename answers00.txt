4.the average time per meter is 175.55555555555554 m/min

5.the shortest distance is the hypothenus of a triangle whose other two sides represent the distances covered by me and by friend respectively. Therefore:

shortestDistance = pow((4.7**2 + 9.4**2), 0.5)*0.62137 miles
python's output is:
shortestDistance = 6.5303001281415085 miles
